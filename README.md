# Javaprogramming

All the codes in this repository was done in order to enhance and demonstrate my own skills in Java. The codes are organised according to the exercise chapters of the book <i>Java Programming</i> by Joyce Farrell 7th Edition ISBN-13: 978-1-285-08195-3 ISBN-10: 1-285-08195-1.

PS: I acknowledge some codes are not well indented because I was using Eclipse IDE at first and then I migrated to Netbeans IDE.
